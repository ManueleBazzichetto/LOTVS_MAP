# Map of the LOTVS collection

This is a repo including the R code used to produce the map of the LOTVS collection (https://lotvs.csic.es/).

Read more about LOTVS [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462383).

This is version 2 of the map, which shows the location of 84 datasets (for 122 localities). The map also reports additional information on the datasets, including: data type (biomass, cover or frequency), accessibility (whether data are open, restricted or partially restricted), and the number of plots associated with each dataset.
